# Driscoll Code Challenge

## Requirements

Node version: 20.11.0

## Installation

### `npm install`

Install of required packages from package.json.

## Usage

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Notes

- Missing tests but I can add them if you want me to (was not mentioned in the specifications)
- Project is not uploaded to npm but as the tests, let me know if you want me to also upload it there
- Since there's no backend/db, I used the context from react for the dummy data. Due to this I couldn't use an `id` directly on a link since those are created when the page initially loads (so the uuids would be different)
